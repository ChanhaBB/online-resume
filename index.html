<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<b>Adobe Inc (June 2022 to Present)</b>
<ul>
    <li>Designed and implemented multithreaded Kafka Consumer with a decoupling of consumption and processing of the
        messages for the team's core service</li>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Impact:</i> zero loss of data, reduced latency</li>
        <li><i>Tech Stack:</i> Java, Spring Boot, Kafka</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>Designed and implemented a core component of spark structured streaming application which processes ~20 billion
        kafka messages a day with 5 minute SLT. The component is responsible for reading data from the delta table as a
        source, and mutating the data in the KV store as a sink.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Impact:</i> 40% reduction in COGS and 32% reduction in the number of database queries from a previous
            Flink based streaming application</li>
        <li><i>Tech Stack:</i> Scala, Java, Spark, Spark Structured Streaming, Delta Table, Azure Data Lake,
            FoundationDB</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Contributed to the team’s open source project Solaris, which is a “jdbc-like” abstraction layer for KV stores, with emphasis on working with graph objects. Modeled exception object hierarchy to provide a translation from technology / database specific errors to a set of standardized kv errors, which users can act upon when using Solaris.
